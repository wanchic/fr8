Palindrome Day, the 1st global palindrome day in 909 years...which is also a palindrome!

Anyway, a month ago I was telling the story to my wife about obtaining the 'fr8' gem name, and to my shock I saw downloads. DOWNLOADS!? What the heck? And I didn't even add any code. 

As of right now, there are 320 downloads!? It's been too long to have NOTHING added, especially since I have so much code written already. The Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year season kept me too busy. So now I'm returning to add... some things!

My hope is to continue to add a little bit each day/week until I get to where I expected to be before the end of 2019.

Thank you to the people who are curious. Stay curious! I guarantee you will not be disappointed to find out what's coming.

## [0.0.0] - 2019-11-11
This project initially started on 2019-09-26 under the gem name of 'freight'. I continued to write code adding about 19 additional updates until 2019-10-18. 

At this point I got frustrated not being able to obtain the 'freight' name even though I was given the blessing from the original owner by email.  without this, I wasn't able to push the code up publicly. And, honestly I was sure which parts of my code I wanted to push up anyway.

So, I creatively (with the inspiration from God) thought up the 'fr8' name. So I immediately wrote a blank gem, push up the code and claimed the 'fr8' on Nov 11, 2019.
